# hadoop-word-count
Write a Hadoop MapReduce program which outputs the number of words with length greater than 5 that start with each letter. This means that for every letter we want to count the total number of words (with length at least 5) that start with that letter. In your implementation ignore the letter case, i.e. consider all words as lower case and ignore words with non-alphabetic characters.
